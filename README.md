A basic profile card project created to practice HTML, CSS, and introduce myself.

## Live Demo

## About the Project

Focus: Built to experiment with foundational web development skills and create a simple online presence.

## How to Use

This project is primarily designed as a learning exercise and a digital profile. There's no direct 'use' outside of it serving as an example.

## Potential Improvements

Responsive Design: Add CSS media queries to make the card adapt well to different screen sizes.
Interactivity: Include subtle JavaScript interactions (e.g., changing button styles on hover).
